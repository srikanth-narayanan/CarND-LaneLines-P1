# Finding Lane Lines on the Road 

This project is an introduction to apply image processing techinques such as masking, canny edge detection and hough transform to detect lanes in an image and extend them to video.

In an autonomous vehicle a front mounted camera is in a fixed postion looking generating a front view of the roads and object. Lanes are of different types, width and quality. Identifying lanes with high confidence is a must for an self driving car or a truck. Hence a roboust logic is required to ensure the intended path of travel is correctly identified.

### Pipeline Development

The pipeline development consits of the following steps.

. Understand the given image or a video file.
. Gray Scale the given image.
. Applying Gaussian filter to reduce noise.
